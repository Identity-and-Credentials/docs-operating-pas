This topic describes upgrading to VMware Tanzu Application Service for VMs (TAS for VMs) v2.8 directly from
Pivotal Application Service (PAS) v2.7 and later.


## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

Jump upgrading describes the process of skipping minor versions when upgrading
<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>. Jump upgrading enables you to upgrade directly to the
long-term support (LTS) version of TAS for VMs, which is v2.8.


## <a id="prerequisites"></a> Prerequisites

Before you jump upgrade to TAS for VMs v2.8:

1. Verify that the products you have installed are compatible with TAS for VMs v2.8. To create an upgrade path for your product tiles, see the [Upgrade Planner](https://upgrade-planner.pivotal.io/).

1. Upgrade <%= vars.ops_manager %> to v2.10 LTS. For more information, see [<%= vars.ops_manager %> v2.10 Release Notes](https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/2-10/release-notes.html).

1. Install the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI). For more information, see [Upgrading to cf CLI v7](../cf-cli/v7.html).

After your deployment meets the requirements described in
[Prerequisites](#prerequisites) above, you can upgrade to TAS for VMs
v2.8.0 or later.

To jump upgrade to TAS for VMs to v2.8.0 or later:

1. Review the breaking changes for each version of <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> included in the jump upgrade.
For example, if you are upgrading from PAS v2.7 to TAS for VMs v2.8, read all of the following breaking changes:
    * [PAS 2.8 Breaking Changes](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/2-8/release-notes/runtime-rn.html#breaking-changes)

1. Review [Configuring <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> for Upgrades](./configuring.html).

2. (Optional) Review release notes for each version of <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> included in the jump upgrade:
    * [PAS 2.8 Release Notes](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/2-8/release-notes/runtime-rn.html)
