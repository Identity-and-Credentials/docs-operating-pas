This topic describes upgrading to VMware Tanzu Application Service for VMs (TAS for VMs) v2.11 directly from
Pivotal Application Service (PAS) v2.7 and later.


## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

Jump upgrading describes the process of skipping minor versions when upgrading
<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>. Jump upgrading enables you to upgrade directly to the
long-term support (LTS) version of TAS for VMs, which is v2.11.
TAS for VMs v2.11 is supported through April 2024.

To minimize downtime for developers pushing apps, upgrade from <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> v2.7.41 or later, or TAS for VMs v2.11.9 or later.
Upgrading from earlier patch versions can result in an `Unknown Error` when pushing apps.

## <a id="prerequisites"></a> Prerequisites

Before you jump upgrade to TAS for VMs v2.11:

1. Verify that the products you have installed are compatible with TAS for VMs v2.11. To create an upgrade path for your product tiles, see the [Upgrade Planner](https://upgrade-planner.pivotal.io/).

1. Upgrade <%= vars.ops_manager %> to v2.10 LTS. For more information, see [<%= vars.ops_manager %> v2.10 Release Notes](https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/2-10/release-notes.html).

1. Install the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI). For more information, see [Upgrading to cf CLI v7](../cf-cli/v7.html).

After your deployment meets the requirements described in
[Prerequisites](#prerequisites) above, you can upgrade to TAS for VMs
v2.11.0 or later.

1. Review [Configuring <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> for Upgrades](./configuring.html).
